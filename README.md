# Blinkit-Sales-Dashboard

🧭 1. Objective of the Dashboard

“The main goal of this dashboard is to analyze Blinkit’s grocery store sales performance — focusing on total sales, outlet types, fat content, and product categories — to understand what drives revenue and how different outlet locations perform.”

📊 2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

At the top, the main summary cards show:

Sum of Total Sales → 1.20M
→ Total revenue generated across all outlets.

Sum of Rating → 33K
→ Combined customer ratings, representing customer engagement and satisfaction.

Count of Outlet Size → 3
→ There are three types of outlet sizes analyzed: High, Medium, and Small.

💡 This gives an instant overview of business scale and customer response.

🏪 3. Outlet and Store Insights
➤ Outlet Location & Size Filters

“These slicers allow filtering by outlet location (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3) and size (High, Medium, Small).
They help compare sales performance across city types — e.g., metro vs. rural — and store size.”

➤ Total Sales by Outlet Type

“Supermarket Type 1 contributes the majority of total sales — significantly higher than Grocery Store, Type 2, and Type 3.
This suggests that modern-format stores are driving most revenue.”

➤ Sum of Total Sales by Outlet Location Type

“Tier 3 outlets perform slightly better than Tier 1 and Tier 2 in total sales.
This could indicate strong sales potential in smaller cities.”

🛒 4. Product-Level Insights
➤ Total Sales by Item Type

“The top-selling categories are Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods, followed by Household and Frozen Foods.
This highlights which categories bring the highest revenue contribution.”

➤ Sales by Fat Content

“Low Fat products contribute about 61% of total sales, while Regular Fat items make up around 34%, and High Fat items about 3–4%.
This indicates consumer preference toward healthier options.”

📈 5. Time-Based Trends
➤ Sales by Establishment Year

“This line chart shows how many outlets were established each year and how sales vary over time.
It helps understand business growth and historical trends — for example, a dip around 2010 and recovery after 2020.”

⚙️ 6. Tools and Features Used

“I built this dashboard in Power BI, using:

Data cleaning and transformations in Power Query,
